# CSW_TENSION-SD2

## Introduction
This repository is a combination of the efforts of Jason Silva and Abdirahim Ahmed.

## Organization
There are three branches: the main branch, the silva branch, and the ahmed branch. The main branch is ONLY for merging after successful testing from **both** parties.

## Main Objective: Font Problems
Ahmed has reported issues with font sizes on the TFT. The first iteration of the main branch is the original code, and must be kept that way. Other iterations throughout the main branch.

## Procedure
Jason and Ahmed will meet in-person on Tuesdays and Thursdays at 10:00 AM. The arduino and the touchscreen must be physically present and connected at all times to whichever laptop is available and able to upload the code.
Jason's branch will be created on-campus with the units on-hand given to him by Ahmed. No code must be edited in Jason's branch except for Jason himself. The same applies for Ahmed's branch.
The procedure will be as follows:
1. Upload problematic code with no changes
2. Create two separate branches: Jason will code in-person with the Arduino and touchscreen on loan. Ahmed will code anywhere that is most convenient, but must update the branch frequently with descriptions of what updates have been made
3. Once one or both parties find the solution, discuss the solution in as much detail as possible in comment lines.
4. Merge whichever branch to the main branch to save its state. 

***Please ensure that the programmer sticks to their branch to prevent complications and to keep things organized as much as possible.***
